EVENT FEED
you're not very happy. try tapping that 0
that did it! you're getting happier!
you're just a baby. so full of potential.
try to get as much happiness as you can before your time runs out!
you're doing great! you're getting so much happiness.
ooh I bet a pacifier would make you happy
that pacifier is making you so happy!
that milk bottle is making you even happier than the pacifier made you!
oh my gosh you're getting so happy. your life is going to be so great

you're a big kid now!

mmm candy. you love candy.

you got a bike??? wow! that's making you so happy!

your baseball mitt is making you happy!

comics! you love comics. you can get more comics and they'll make you even happier!

hm it looks like Billy has a better bike than you... I bet a better bike would make you really really happy.
a new bike! it's a little better than your last one... it's actually not that different.

you fell in love! she's your best friend and makes you a better person.

you got married!

you had your first child! a girl. she's perfect. you've never been so happy.

you had another baby! you start to worry about money a little bit. maybe you should get a new job.

your wife isn't looking so great lately... also, that young waitress gave you an extra slice of pie...
you did it. you divorced your wife and married for looks. I guess that made you kind of happy...

you got a better job! it requires more hours, (and you don't see your kids as much : and it's a lot more responsibility), but it pays really well!

you're retired! you can do all the things you dreamed of when you (and your first wife) were young. you don't have a lot of energy anymore but that's ok.
you're in Bermuda! a lot of the people here are impoverished. you ignore it. your happiness rises!
you're in London! it's... really similar to home actually. this was an expensive trip.
you're running out of money for travel
you're in Paris! most people are really rude to you. you stay in the hotel most of the trip.
your wife died. she always wanted to see (the remaining travel destination)
you're in Mexico! you heard there are lots of gangs here so you pretty much stay on the resort. margaritas! (you think about your wife a lot)
well I guess that's it. your retirement is running out.
check into assisted living
what's the point?
is this making you happy?
you should call your family.
it's just a game.
put the phone down.
seriously, it's just a game. like, the number goes up and that's it.
it isn't really happiness.
I hope you're not wasting your life. you've been playing for a long time.
you're going to die.


END
game over! you died! I guess you were kind of happy while you were alive...


TROPHIES
